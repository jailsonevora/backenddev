<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size"> Publish-Subscribe Messaging systems play an important role in any enterprise architecture as it enables reliable integration without tightly coupling the applications. The ability to share data between decoupled systems is not a problem that is easily tackled.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Consider an enterprise with multiple applications that are being built independently, with different languages and platforms. It needs to share data and processes in a responsive way. We can achieve this using Messaging to transfer packets of data frequently, immediately, reliably, and asynchronously, using customizable formats. Asynchronous messaging is fundamentally a pragmatic reaction to the problems of distributed systems. Sending a message does not require both systems to be up and ready at the same time.</p>



<div style="height:60px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Publish-Subscribe Channel </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">  From a simple perspective, the understanding of this pattern relies on its expands upon the Observer pattern by adding the notion of an event channel for communicating event notifications. The Observer pattern describes the need to decouple observers from their subject so that the subject can easily provide event notification to all interested observers no matter how many observers there are.  </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Each subscriber needs to be notified of a particular event once, but should not be notified repeatedly of the same event. The event cannot be considered consumed until all of the subscribers have been notified. But once all of the subscribers have been notified, the event can be considered consumed and should disappear from the channel [2]. </p>



<div style="height:64px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Broker, Queues, Topics, and Subscriptions</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Brokered messaging supports the scenario of truly temporal decoupled systems where either message producer or consumer availability is not guaranteed.&nbsp;With Brokered messaging, the queue is the broker that retains a message created by a producer and where the consumer can retrieve the message when ready. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Queue provides the simplest message delivery option.&nbsp;Messages in a Queue are organized by first-in, first-out (FIFO), and each message is expected to be processed by a single consumer. However, Topics and Subscriptions constitute a publish/subscribe pattern allowing the same message to be processed by N number of consumers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="522" height="192" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4.png" alt="Publish-Subscribe Messaging System" class="wp-image-1374" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4.png 522w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-300x110.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> A single message can be added to a topic and for every subscription rule that is satisfied, a copy of the message will be added to that subscription.&nbsp;In this case, each subscription becomes the queue, where consumers can process the messages on a subscription individually. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the reliable and mature projects that are being utilized by industry leaders is Apache Kafka which provides us the capability to handle a huge number of messages per second, instead of traditional messaging systems that have been quite useful in traditional scenarios but not efficient and valuable in handling Big Data scenarios.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Beyond messaging, Apache Kafka can be applied in stream processing, website activity tracking, log aggregation, metrics, time-based message storage, commit log, and event sourcing. In the next section, we will cover in deep the components and characteristics of Apache Kafka.</p>



<div style="height:62px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kafka</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system that is fast, scalable, and distributed in nature by its design, partitioned, and replicated commit log service. It differs from a traditional messaging system to be very easy to scale out, offers high throughput, to supports multi-subscribers and automatically balances the consumers during failure, and has the ability to allow real-time applications or ETL to use it as batch consumption of persisted messages on disk.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Components [1]&nbsp; </h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Producers </strong>&#8211; Producers are any applications/programs that publish messages to Kafka brokers.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="434" height="259" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2.png" alt="Publish-Subscribe Messaging System" class="wp-image-1365" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2.png 434w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-300x179.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px" /></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Consumers </strong>&#8211; Consumers are applications that consume messages from Kafka brokers. These consumers can be a simple application, a real-time stream processing engine, etc. </li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Topics and Partitions</strong> &#8211; Apache Kafka supports the concepts of message Topics that allow categorizing the messages. It enables us to create different Topics for different types of messages and has different consumers consuming messages. Apache Kafka moreover allows creating multiple partitions in a Topic to concede the parallel consumption of messages as we can have separate consumers consuming from different partitions at the same time. Each partition has a leader node that is responsible for accepting the read/write requests from consumers/producers for that partition.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="450" height="260" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3.png" alt="Publish-Subscribe Messaging System" class="wp-image-1366" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3.png 450w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Broker</strong> &#8211; Kafka broker typically refers to a machine with Kafka installed on it. However, it is possible to set up more than one broker on a single machine in a non-production setting. The Kafka broker is responsible for managing the message logs and accepting the requests from producers/consumers. Kafka brokers are stateless. This means that the consumer has to maintain how much it has consumed. The consumer maintains it by himself and the broker would not do anything.</li>



<li><strong>Storage </strong>&#8211;  Kafka has a very simple storage layout. Each partition of a topic corresponds to a logical log. Physically, a log is implemented as a set of segment files of equal sizes. Every time a producer publishes a message to a partition, the broker simply appends the message to the last segment file. Segment file is flushed to disk after configurable numbers of messages have been published or after a certain amount of time elapsed. Messages are exposed to the consumer after it gets flushed.   </li>



<li><strong>Cluster </strong>&#8211; Kafka cluster is a collection of Kafka brokers. All the Kafka brokers in a cluster work collectively to manage the messages and their copies as configured.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="527" height="266" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1.png" alt="Publish-Subscribe Messaging System" class="wp-image-1364" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1.png 527w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1-300x151.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Zookeeper </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">ZooKeeper is used to manage and coordinate the Kafka broker. Each Kafka broker is coordinated with other Kafka brokers using ZooKeeper. The producer and consumer are notified by the ZooKeeper service about the presence of a new broker or failure of the broker in the Kafka system. From the notification received by the Zookeeper regarding the presence or failure of the broker, the producer, and consumer takes the decision and start coordinating their work with some other broker.&nbsp; Also, it is responsible to choose the new leaders for the partitions. </p>



<div style="height:70px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Case Study</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> After a little state of art lets, focus on practice. So, our case study simulates the communication between two microservices built with Spring Boot micro-framework v2.1.8.RELEASE in publish-subscribe context, using Apache Kafka 2.3.1 as a message system. To validate our study we will be setting and executing an integration test that focuses on integrating different layers of the application at an end to end scenarios with the JUnit 4/5 testing framework.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="576" height="391" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-13.png" alt="Publish-Subscribe Messaging System" class="wp-image-1492" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-13.png 576w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-13-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Producer API is a module that implements the operation for a <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/09/16/key-java-annotations-to-build-spring-boot-rest-api/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business entity service</a> with the intention to coordinate and harmonize economic information relating to enterprises, establishments, and groups of entities. The Consumer API is another module in the same solution which aims to centralize all business entity statistics, receiving data input from a different source.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For the sake of simplicity, the APIs use the H2 in-memory database. The project structure is composed of three modules. Both major modules, Producer, and Consumer have a dependency on the Common module, which shares things like error handling and auxiliary classes with the remaining part of the system. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The sample is accessible from the GitHub repository; to download it, please follow this&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/JERBEvora/spring-boot-api-communication-through-kafka" target="_blank">link</a>. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>



<div style="height:67px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Integrating Spring Kafka with Apache Kafka Message System</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Spring for Apache Kafka project applies core Spring concepts to the development of Kafka-based messaging solutions. It provides a &#8220;template&#8221; as a high-level abstraction for sending messages. It also provides support for Message-driven POJOs with @KafkaListener annotations and a &#8220;listener container&#8221;. These libraries promote the use of dependency injection and declarative [3].</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Producer API</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We need two steps to config a producer. The first one is the config class where we define the producer Map object, the producer factory, and the Kafka template. The second is respected to the service class when we set the message builder to publish in Kafka broker.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Producer Config</h4>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the configuration class, the constant  &#8220;<em>bootstrapServers&#8221;</em> which is the Kafka server is set in application.properties. Using the <a aria-label="@Value(&quot;${spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers}&quot;) (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Value.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Value(&#8220;${spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers}&#8221;)</a> annotation indicates a default value expression for the affected argument. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To create a Kafka producer, we define certain properties that we pass to the constructor of a Kafka producer. In &#8220;<em>producerconfigs</em>&#8221; @Bean we set the BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG property to the list of broker addresses we defined earlier in application.properties. BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG value is a comma-separated list of host/port pairs that the Producer uses to establish an initial connection to the Kafka cluster.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
package com.BusinessEntityManagementSystem;

import ...

@Configuration
public class KafkaProducerConfig {

    @Value(&quot;${spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers}&quot;)
    private String bootstrapServers;

    @Bean
    public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; producerConfigs() {
        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; props = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, bootstrapServers);
        props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class);
        props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, JsonSerializer.class);
        return props;
    }

    @Bean
    public ProducerFactory&lt;String, BusinessEntity&gt; producerFactory() {
        return new DefaultKafkaProducerFactory&lt;&gt;(producerConfigs());
    }

    @Bean
    public KafkaTemplate&lt;String, BusinessEntity&gt; kafkaTemplate() {
        return new KafkaTemplate&lt;String, BusinessEntity&gt;(producerFactory());
    }
}
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">The KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG is a Kafka Serializer class for Kafka record keys that implements the Kafka Serializer interface. Notice that we set this to StringSerializer.class as the message ids. The VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG is a Kafka Serializer class that we set it to JsonSerializer.class as the message body.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To create messages, first, we need to configure a ProducerFactory which sets the strategy for creating Kafka Producer instances. Then we need a KafkaTemplate which wraps a Producer instance and provides convenience methods for sending messages to Kafka topics using our data transfer object &#8220;<em>BusinessEntity</em>&#8220;.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Producer Service</h4>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the Kafka Producer Service class, the <a aria-label="@Service (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Service.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Service</a> annotation indicates that the annotated class is a &#8220;Service&#8221;. In this class we implement the method to send the messages to the Kafka broker, declaring the topic attribute on the header predefined in the application.properties.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
package com.BusinessEntityManagementSystem.kafka;

import ...

@Service
public class KafkaProducer {

    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate&lt;String, BusinessEntity&gt; kafkaTemplate;

    @Value(&quot;${statistics.kafka.topic}&quot;)
    String kafkaTopic;

    public void send(BusinessEntity payload) {
        Message&lt;BusinessEntity&gt; message = MessageBuilder
                .withPayload(payload)
                .setHeader(KafkaHeaders.TOPIC, kafkaTopic)
                .build();
        kafkaTemplate.send(message);
    }
}
</pre></div>


<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Consumer API</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In consumer, we need to add the appropriate Deserializer which can convert JSON byte[] into a Java Object. To set it, we need the class config and the class annotated with @components that will autodetect this class for dependency injection when annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning is used.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Consumer Config</h4>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As well, as we specify the KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, and VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG to serialize the message published by the producer, we also need to inform the Spring Kafka about constant values for deserialization like KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG and  VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG. Beyond the constants referenced above, we specify the GROUP_ID_CONFIG and AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG as the earliest, allowing the consumer to read the last inserted message in the broker.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> To enable Kafka listeners, we use the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/2.1.2.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/kafka/annotation/EnableKafka.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@EnableKafka</a> annotation.  These annotated endpoints are created under the covers by an <a aria-label="AbstractListenerContainerFactory (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/2.1.2.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/kafka/config/AbstractKafkaListenerContainerFactory.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AbstractListenerContainerFactory</a>. The KafkaListenerContainerFactory is responsible to create the listener container for a particular endpoint. It enables the detection of&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/2.1.2.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/kafka/annotation/KafkaListener.html">KafkaListener </a>annotations on any Spring-managed bean in the container. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-left has-medium-font-size"> As typical implementations, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/2.1.2.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/kafka/config/ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory.html" target="_blank">ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory</a> provides the necessary configuration options that are supported by the underlying <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/2.1.2.RELEASE/api/org/springframework/kafka/listener/MessageListenerContainer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MessageListenerContainer (opens in a new tab)">MessageListenerContainer</a>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
package com.BusinessStatisticsUnitFiles;

import ...

@Configuration
@EnableKafka
public class KafkaConsumerConfig {

    @Value(&quot;${spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers}&quot;)
    private String bootstrapServers;

    @Bean
    public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; consumerConfigs() {
        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; props = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, bootstrapServers);
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class);
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, JsonDeserializer.class);
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, &quot;statistics-BusinessStatisticsUnitFiles-group&quot;);
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, &quot;earliest&quot;);
        return props;
    }

    @Bean
    public ConsumerFactory&lt;String, BusinessEntity&gt; consumerFactory() {
        return new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory&lt;&gt;(
                consumerConfigs(),
                new StringDeserializer(),
                new JsonDeserializer&lt;&gt;(BusinessEntity.class, false));
    }

    @Bean
    public ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory&lt;String, BusinessEntity&gt; kafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
        ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory&lt;String, BusinessEntity&gt; factory =
                new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory&lt;&gt;();
        factory.setConsumerFactory(consumerFactory());
        return factory;
    }
}
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">On the consumer factory, we have the possibility to disable the use of headers. this is achieved now by setting to false the second parameter in <em>new JsonDeserializer&lt;&gt;(BusinessEntity.class, false));</em>. This allows the consumer to trust messages that come from any package.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Consumer &#8220;Service&#8221;</h4>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For consuming messages, It is necessary to have configured the  ConsumerFactory and a KafkaListenerContainerFactory as we did above. Once these beans are available in the Spring bean factory, POJO-based consumers can be configured using <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/api/org/springframework/kafka/annotation/KafkaListener.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@KafkaListener</a> annotation.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="@KafkaHandler (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/api/org/springframework/kafka/annotation/KafkaHandler.html" target="_blank">@KafkaHandler </a>also is necessary to mark a method to be the target of a Kafka message listener within a class that is annotated with @KafkaListener. It is important to understand that when a message arrives, the method selected depends on the payload type. The type is matched with a single non-annotated parameter or one that is annotated with @Payload. There must be no ambiguity &#8211; the system must be able to select exactly one method based on the payload type.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
package com.BusinessStatisticsUnitFiles.kafka;

import ...

@Component
public class KafkaConsumer {

    @Autowired
    IBusinessEntityRepository businessEntityRepository;

    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(BusinessEntity.class);


    @KafkaListener(topics = &quot;${statistics.kafka.topic.create.entity}&quot;, groupId = &quot;statistics-BusinessEntityManagementSystem-group&quot;)
    @KafkaHandler
    public void receiveCreatedEntity(@Payload BusinessEntity data,
                                    @Headers MessageHeaders headers) {
     businessEntityRepository.save(RetrieveConsumerFromReceivedProducerObject.Binding(new BusinessEntityModel(), data));
    }
}
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">  The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/handler/annotation/Payload.html" target="_blank">@Payload</a> annotation binds a method parameter to the payload of a message. It can also be used to associate a payload to a method invocation. The payload may be passed through a <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/converter/MessageConverter.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MessageConverter (opens in a new tab)">MessageConverter</a>&nbsp;to convert it from serialized form with a specific MIME type to an Object matching the target method parameter. Our class annotated with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/handler/annotation/Payload.html" target="_blank">@Payload</a> is the <em>&#8220;BusinessEntity&#8221;</em> DTO.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Spring Boot also supports retrieval of one or more message headers using the @Headers annotation in the listener. Multiple listeners can be implemented for a topic, each with a different group Id. Furthermore, one consumer can listen to messages from various topics.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As you may have noticed, we created the topic&nbsp;building&nbsp;with only one partition. However, for a topic with multiple partitions, a&nbsp;<em>@<a href="https://jailsonevora.com/2019/09/16/key-java-annotations-to-build-spring-boot-rest-api/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KafkaListener</a></em>&nbsp;can explicitly subscribe to a particular partition of a topic with an initial offset.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Application.properties</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Last but not least in our configuration, we specify some values related to the behavior of communication between the Producer and Consumer.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Producer/ Consumer  </h4>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">On each Producer and Consumer API, we define the Kafka cluster we want our microservices to connect with, using the spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092. Also, it is necessary to define the topic name to produce and receive messages, the key as well as the group-id.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: r; title: ; notranslate">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preparing the Kafka and Zookeeper for Integration Test </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The steps defined below demonstrate how to run and test Kafka on Windows 10 operating system.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Download Kafka with embedded Zookeeper</h3>



<ol>
<li>Download the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kafka.apache.org/downloads" target="_blank">Kafka binaries</a>. This post is based on Kafka 2.3.1, and hence we assume that you are downloading a 2.3.1 version for Scala 2.12.</li>



<li>Un-zip the&nbsp;<em>kafka_2.12-2.3.1.tgz&nbsp;</em>file.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Setting zookeeper.properties</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To make it work, we need to change the Zookeeper data directory location.<br>Open&nbsp;the <em>kafka\config\zookeeper.properties</em>&nbsp;file and change the Zookeeper data /log directory location config to a valid windows directory location.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">
dataDir=C:\\kafka\\zookeeper-logs
</pre></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Setting server.properties</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> We also need to make some changes to the Kafka configurations. Open&nbsp;<em>kafka\config\server.properties</em>&nbsp;and set topic defaults to one. We will be running a single-node, Kafka. Also to prevent Kafka to create unnecessary numbers of offset, we specify the replicas to 1. We faced this issue on the windows environment with the latest Kafka 2.3.1 version. This led Kafka to stop because of insufficient memory to handle a bunch of data created automatically on the initial phase of starting the server.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">
############################# Log Basics #############################

log.dirs=C:\\kafka\\kafka-logs

####################### Internal Topic Settings  #####################

offsets.topic.replication.factor=1
offsets.topic.num.partitions = 1 
min.insync.replicas=1 
default.replication.factor = 1
...
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">To finish the Kafka configuration, add Kafka&nbsp;<em>bin\windows</em>&nbsp;directory to the PATH environment variable.</p>



<div style="height:42px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create and Executing Integration Test</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As the name suggests, integration tests focus on integrating different layers of the application, where no mocking is involved. The integration tests need to start up a container to execute the test cases. Hence, some additional setup is required for this, but with spring boot these steps are easy using some annotations and libraries.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Test Class</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The first annotation @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) is used to provide a bridge between Spring Boot test features and JUnit. SpringRunner.class enables full support of spring context loading and dependency injection of the beans in the tests. <a aria-label="@SpringBootTest (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/context/SpringBootTest.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@SpringBootTest</a> creates ApplicationContext tests through SpringApplication that will be utilized in our tests. It bootstraps the entire container from the embedded server and creates a web environment.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In our test, we are mimicking the real web environment setting it as RANDOM_PORT that also loads WebServerApplicationContext. The embedded server is started and listened to on a random port.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = {BusinessEntityManagementApplication.class}, webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
class BusinessEntityIntegrationTest {

    @LocalServerPort
    private int port;

    @Autowired
    TestRestTemplate restTemplate;
    HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a aria-label="@LocalServerPort (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.0.RC1/api/org/springframework/boot/web/server/LocalServerPort.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@LocalServerPort</a> annotation provides us with the injected HTTP port that got allocated at runtime. It is a convenient alternative for&nbsp;<code>@Value("${local.server.port}")</code>. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To access a third-party REST service inside a Spring application we use the Spring&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RestTemplate</a></strong>&nbsp;or <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/web/client/TestRestTemplate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TestRestTemplate </a>the convenient alternative that is suitable for integration tests by injecting it into our test class. With <strong>spring-boot-starter-test</strong>&nbsp;dependency in our project, we can access to&nbsp;&#8220;TestRestTemplate&#8221;&nbsp;class in runtime. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Test Method</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In our test method, we are using the &#8220;<a aria-label="junit-json-params (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.joshka.net/junit-json-params/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">junit-json-params</a>&#8220;, a <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Junit 5</a> library that provides annotations to load data from JSON Strings or files in parameterized tests. We also annotated the method with <a aria-label="@ParameterizedTest (opens in a new tab)" href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.3.0/api/org/junit/jupiter/params/ParameterizedTest.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@ParameterizedTest</a> annotation to complement the library below. It is used to signal the annotated method is a parameterized test method. That method must not be private or static. They also must specify at least one&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.3.0/api/org/junit/jupiter/params/provider/ArgumentsProvider.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>ArgumentsProvider</code></a>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.3.0/api/org/junit/jupiter/params/provider/ArgumentsSource.html"><code>@ArgumentsSource</code></a>&nbsp;or a corresponding composed annotation.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our  <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.3.0/api/org/junit/jupiter/params/provider/ArgumentsSource.html"><code>@ArgumentsSource</code></a> a JSON file @JsonFileSource(resources = &#8220;/business-entity-test-param.json&#8221;) is inside the test.resource package.  <code>@JsonFileSource</code>&nbsp;lets you use JSON files from the classpath. It supports single objects, arrays of objects, and JSON primitives. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The JSON object retrieved from the file is bound to the method params &#8220;object&#8221; that it is converted to a POJO object, in this case, our entity model.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
    @ParameterizedTest
    @JsonFileSource(resources = &quot;/business-entity-test-param.json&quot;)
    @DisplayName(&quot;create business entity with json parameter&quot;)
    void createBusinessEntity(JsonObject object) throws IOException, URISyntaxException {

        BusinessEntityModel businessEntityModel;
        businessEntityModel = new BusinessEntityModel();

        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        businessEntityModel = mapper.readValue(object.toString(), BusinessEntityModel.class);

        HttpEntity&lt;BusinessEntityModel&gt; request = new HttpEntity&lt;&gt;(businessEntityModel, headers);

        try {

            ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; response = this.restTemplate.postForEntity(createURLWithPort(&quot;/api/businessEntityManagementSystem/v1/businessEntity&quot;), request, String.class);
            assertAll(
                    () -&gt; assertThat(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.CREATED.value()),
                    () -&gt; assertThat(response.getHeaders().getLocation().getPath()).contains(&quot;/v1&quot;)
            );
        }
        catch(HttpClientErrorException ex) {
            assertAll(
                    () -&gt; Assert.assertEquals(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST.value(), ex.getRawStatusCode()),
                    () -&gt; Assert.assertEquals(true, ex.getResponseBodyAsString().contains(&quot;Missing request header&quot;))
            );
        }
    }
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">After the arrangement and acts we assert if our call to the rest API returns the desired result. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Run Integration Test</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="738" height="508" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-14.png" alt="Intellij Integration test" class="wp-image-1516" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-14.png 738w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-14-300x207.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In our development environment, we need to grant that our Kafka and Zookeeper are up and running in two different consoles as described in the figure. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Kafka needs Zookeeper, so we will first start Zookeeper using the below command. </p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
c:\kafka&gt;.\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size"> It should start the zookeeper server. Minimize the command window and let the zookeeper run in that window. Start a new command window and start Kafka Broker using the below command.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">
 c:\kafka&gt;.\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties
</pre></div>


<p>Next, we will run our Consumer API in our IDE or we can also deploy it.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Finally, we can execute the test class as a JUnit test. It will start the server and deploy the API as it will be done normally. Then It will execute the tests. You can verify the tests in the JUnit tab.</p>



<div style="height:54px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In this article, we have seen how we can use the publish-subscribe pattern to share data frequently, immediately, reliably, and asynchronously using customizable formats in a responsive way between two distinct microservices and validate it with an integration test through different layers at an end to end scenario.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">This post aims to demonstrate key Java @annotations used to build a functional Spring Boot Rest API. The use of Java annotation gives developers the capability to reduce the code verbosity by a simple annotation. As an example, we can refer to a transaction. By the standard pro-grammatically process with a transaction template, this requires a more complex config and boilerplate code to write, while this can be achieved with a simple @Transaction declarative annotation.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the Java computer programming language, an annotation is a form of syntactic metadata that can be added to Java source code. Java annotations can also be embedded in and read from Java class files generated by the Java compiler. This allows annotations to be retained by the Java virtual machine at run-time and read via reflection. The support for annotation starts from version 5 allowing different Java frameworks to adopt these resources.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Annotation can also be used in REST API. REST stands for Representational State Transfer and it is an architectural style for designing distributed applications. Brought by Roy Fielding in his Ph.D. dissertation where he proposed as its basis, six principles that should be separated between clients and servers; the communication between client and server should be stateless; multiple hierarchical layers can exist between them; the server responses must be declared as cacheable or noncacheable; the uniformity of their interfaces must be based in all interactions between client, server, and intermediary components and finally the clients can extend their functionality by using code on demand.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Case Study</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> The <a href="https://jailsonevora.com/2019/11/18/publish-subscribe-messaging-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">API</a> is a simple module to implement CRUD operation of Business Entity from a more complex system intended to coordinate and harmonize economic information relating to enterprises, establishments, and groups of entities. For the sake of simplicity, the <a href="https://jailsonevora.com/2019/08/24/microservices-security-mechanisms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">API</a> uses the H2 in-memory database. </p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The project structure is constituted of three modules, but this post will focus on the module to manage entities. That module has a dependency on the Common module, which shares things like error handling and essential useful classes with the remaining part of the whole system.  The sample code is accessible from the GitHub repository, to download it, please follow this <a href="https://github.com/jailsonevora/spring-boot-api-communication-through-kafka" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link</a>, let&#8217;s get started.</p>



<div style="height:35px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Spring Boot Auto-Configuration</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The great advantage of Spring Boot is that we can focus on the business rules avoiding some tedious development steps, boilerplate code, and a more complex configuration improving the development and easing the bootstrapping of new spring applications.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To start the configuration of a new spring boot application, spring initializr creates a simple POJO class to configure the initialization of the application. We have two ways to decorate the configuration. One is using the @SpringBootApplication annotation when we have fewer modules in our solution. If we have a solution with a more complex structure, we need to specify the different paths or the base packages of our modules to the spring boot application initializer class. We can achieve it using @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan annotations. @EnableAutoConfiguration instructs spring boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings, while @ComponentScan allows spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the package, letting it find the controllers among other components. These two annotations can not be used at the same time with @SpringBootApplication. @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of them. It is equivalent to using @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan with their default attributes.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
package com.BusinessEntityManagementSystem;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.domain.EntityScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.config.EnableJpaAuditing;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.config.EnableJpaRepositories;

@EnableAutoConfiguration
@EnableJpaAuditing
@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = {&quot;com.BusinessEntityManagementSystem&quot;})
@EntityScan(basePackages = {&quot;com.BusinessEntityManagementSystem&quot;})
@ComponentScan(basePackages = {&quot;com.BusinessEntityManagementSystem&quot;})
@Configuration
public class BusinessEntityManagementApplication {

    public static void main(String&#91;] args) {

        SpringApplication.run(BusinessEntityManagementApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another annotation present in the code snippet is the @EnableJpaAuditing. The auditing allows the system to track and log events related to persistent entities, or entity versioning. Also related to JPA configuration, we have the @EnableJpaRepositories. This annotation enables JPA repositories. It will scan the package of the annotated configuration class for Spring Data repositories by default. Inside this annotation, we specify the base package to be scanned for annotated components. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To find the JPA entities in the project structure, we must instruct the auto-configuration to scan packages using the <a aria-label="@EntityScan (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/domain/EntityScan.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@EntityScan</a>. For a specific scan, we can specify&nbsp;<code><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/domain/EntityScan.html#basePackageClasses--" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basePackageClasses()</a></code>,&nbsp;<code><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/domain/EntityScan.html#basePackages--" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basePackages()</a></code>&nbsp;or its alias&nbsp;<code><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/domain/EntityScan.html#value--" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">value()</a></code>&nbsp;to define specific packages to scan. If specific packages are not defined, scanning will occur from the package of the class with this annotation.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The final annotation in the class created by spring boot initializr is @Configuration. @Configuration tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context. This can be applied in any configuration class that we need. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Java @Annotations in Swagger UI Config</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Documentation is an important aspect of any project, therefore our Rest API is documented using the Swagger-UI, one of the many standards metadata to do it.  Swagger is a specification and a framework for creating interactive REST API documentation. It enables documentation to be in sync with any changes made to REST services. It also provides a set of tools and SDK generators for generating API client code [2]. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the Swagger-UI class configuration, the first annotation to appear is the  @Configuration. As we described above, this indicates to spring boot auto-configuration that a class is a configuration class that may contain bean definitions. </p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">

    }
  	...
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">A specific annotation for Swagger is the <a aria-label="@EnableSwagger2 (opens in a new tab)" href="http://springfox.github.io/springfox/javadoc/2.5.0/springfox/documentation/swagger2/annotations/EnableSwagger2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@EnableSwagger2</a>. It indicates that Swagger support should be enabled and to be loaded all required beans defined in see swagger java-config class. This should be applied to a Spring Java config and should have an accompanying @Configuration annotation. The <a aria-label="@Bean (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-javaconfig/docs/1.0.0.M4/reference/html/ch02s02.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Bean</a> is a method-level annotation and a direct analog of the XML&nbsp;<code>&lt;bean/&gt;</code>&nbsp;element.</p>



<div style="height:41px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Domain Model</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> MVC is one of the most important modules of the Spring Framework. It is a common design pattern in UI design. It decouples business logic from UIs by separating the roles of model, view, and controller. The core idea of the MVC pattern is to separate business logic from UIs to allow them to change independently without affecting each other. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In this design pattern, M stands for Models. The model is responsible for encapsulating application data for views to present. It represents the shape of the data and business logic. Model objects retrieve and store model state in a database. Its models usually consist of domain objects that are processed by the service layer and persisted by the persistence layer.  </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">TYPE Java @Annotations </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> In the model class, we use @Entity annotation which indicates this class is a JPA entity. JPA will be aware that the POJO class can be stored in the database. If we do not define @Table annotation, spring config will assume that this entity is mapped to a table like the POJO class name. So, in these cases, we can specify the table name using the&nbsp;<em>@Table</em>&nbsp;annotation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To handle the problem related to the serialization of the model using Jackson API when the model attributes have a lazy loading defined, we have to tell the serializer to ignore the chain or helpful garbage that Hibernate adds to classes, so it can manage the lazy loading of data by declaring @JsonIgnoreProperties({&#8220;hibernateLazyInitializer&#8221;, &#8220;handler&#8221;}) annotation.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">FIELD Java @Annotations</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For a class field, there are many kinds of annotations dependent on the type and purpose of that field. For example, the @Id annotation must be declared in one of the class attributes. Every entity object stored in the database has a primary key. Once assigned, the primary key cannot be modified. @GeneratedValue indicates that the framework should generate the document key value using the specified generator type like  AUTO, IDENTITY, SEQUENCE, and TABLE. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another interesting annotation targeting the domain model field is @NotNull. It is a common Spring annotation to declare that annotated elements cannot be&nbsp;null.&nbsp; It can be used as well in a method or parameter. The @Column annotation specifies the name of the database column and also the table behavior. This behavior can be set to prevent it from being updated or to be null.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sometimes most objects have a natural identifier, so Hibernate also allows modeling this identifier as a natural identifier of an entity and provides an extra API for retrieving them from the database.  This is achieved using @NaturalId annotation.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
...

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    @NotNull
    @Column(name = &quot;ID_BusinessEntity&quot;, updatable = false, nullable = false)
    private long id;

    @NaturalId
    @NotEmpty
    @NotNull
    @Column(name = &quot;NATURAL_ID&quot;, updatable = false, nullable = false)
    private long naturalId;

    @Column(name = &quot;TaxId&quot;)
    @Size(min = 1, max = 50)
    private String taxId;

    @Column(name = &quot;Status&quot;)
    private int status = 1;

...
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">If we want to prevent the element of an entity to be not null nor empty, we can also annotate it with @NotEmpty. It targets a vast kind of element, since {METHOD,FIELD,ANNOTATION_TYPE,CONSTRUCTOR,PARAMETER,TYPE_USE}. The @Size annotation delimits the boundaries of the element annotated. The boundaries are specified by two attributes, min, and max.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Relationships Java @Annotations </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">One of the most important features of any ORM mechanism is how one specifies the mapping from relationships between Objects to their database counterparts. In the code below, there is a @OneToOne annotation to describe the relationship between the BusinessEntity class with the Address class model. The @JoinColumn annotation specifies the column that will be treated as a foreign key in this relationship.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As well, as @OneToOne annotation, we can manage many to many relationships. <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/jpa/2.1/api/javax/persistence/ManyToMany.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="@ManyToMany (opens in a new tab)">@ManyToMany</a> annotation describes the relationship with members of the Partner class. Like other relationship annotations, it is also possible to specify cascade rules as well as the fetch type. Dependent on the cascade chosen setting, when a BusinessEntity is deleted, the associated Partner will also be deleted.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
...
    // region OneToOne

    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade =  CascadeType.ALL, targetEntity= AddressModel.class)
    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;Address&quot;, nullable = false)
    @OnDelete(action = OnDeleteAction.CASCADE)
    private IAddressModel address;

    // endregion OneToOne


    // region ManyToMany

    @ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY,
            cascade = {
                    CascadeType.ALL
            },
            targetEntity= PartnerModel.class
    )
    @JoinTable(name = &quot;BSUF_BusinessEntity_Partner&quot;,
            joinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = &quot;ID_BusinessEntity&quot;) },
            inverseJoinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = &quot;ID_Partner&quot;) })
    private Set&lt;IPartnerModel&gt; partner = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
	
	// endregion ManyToMany
...
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Together with the @ManyToMany annotation, we specify the @JoinTable annotation that allows us in many-to-many relations to define the bridge table between two other related tables, using two essential attributes, joincolumns for the class where we declare the @ManyToMany annotation and inverseJoinColumns for another table. </p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
...
  // inverser many to many
  
  @ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY,
              cascade = {
                CascadeType.PERSIST,
                CascadeType.MERGE
              },
              mappedBy = &quot;partner&quot;)
  @JsonIgnore
  private Set&lt;IBusinessEntityModel&gt; businessEntity = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
...
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size"> In the other table, it is recommended to define also the inverse relation. This declaration is slightly different from the showed in code related to the Business Entity model. The inverse relation declaration differentiates by the attribute &#8220;mappedBy&#8221;.  </p>



<div style="height:42px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Data Transfer Object</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Data transfer object is a very popular design pattern. It is an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network. DTO is only used to pass data and does not contain any business logic. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">TYPE Java @Annotations</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sometimes we need to transfer data between entities through JSON. To serialize and deserialize the DTO object, we need to annotate these objects with Jackson&#8217;s annotation. The @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL) indicates when the annotated property can be serialized. By using this annotation we can specify simple exclusion rules based on property values. It can be used on a field, method, or constructor parameter. It can also be used in classes where in some cases the specified rules are applied to all properties of the class. </p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
package com.BusinessEntityManagementSystem.dataTransferObject;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnoreProperties;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;

/*@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)*/
@JsonIgnoreProperties({&quot;hibernateLazyInitializer&quot;, &quot;handler&quot;})
public class BusinessEntity {
...
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">@JsonIgnoreProperties({&#8220;hibernateLazyInitializer&#8221;, &#8220;handler&#8221;}) allows Jackson to ignore the garbage created by Hibernate, so it can manage lazy loading of data as referred before.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> FIELD Java @Annotations </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A field in DTO objects might have different kinds of annotations as well. @JsonProperty annotation is used to specify the name of the serialized properties. @JsonIgnore is annotated at a class property level to ignore it. Along with @JsonIgnore, there are also @JsonIgnoreProperties and @JsonIgnoreType. Both annotations are part of Jackson API and are used to ignore logical properties in JSON serialization and deserialization. </p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnoreProperties;

    private long naturalId;

    @JsonProperty(&quot;taxId&quot;)
    private String taxId;

    @JsonProperty(&quot;status&quot;)
    private int status = 1;
...
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">Jackson API  is a high-performance JSON processor for Java. It provides many useful annotations to apply on DTO objects, allowing us to serialize and deserialize objects from JSON to JSON.</p>



<div style="height:43px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Controller</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Controllers stand for C on the MVC pattern. Controllers are responsible for receiving requests from users and invoking back-end services for business processing. After processing, it may return some data for views to present. Controllers collect it and prepare models for views to present. Controllers are often referred to as dispatcher servlets. It acts as the front controller of the Spring MVC framework, and every web request must go through it so that it can manage the entire request-handling process [3]. When a web request is sent to a Spring MVC application, a controller first receives the request. Then it organizes the different components configured in Spring’s web application context or annotations present in the controller itself, all needed to handle the request.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> TYPE Java @Annotations</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To define a controller class in Spring Boot, a class has to be marked with the @RestController annotation. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="@RestController (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RestController.html" target="_blank">@RestController </a>annotation  is a convenience annotation that is itself annotated with&nbsp;<code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Controller.html" target="_blank">@Controller</a></code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ResponseBody.html" target="_blank">@ResponseBody</a></code>.  Types that carry this annotation are treated as controllers where&nbsp;<code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestMapping.html" target="_blank">@RequestMapping</a></code>&nbsp;methods assume&nbsp;<code><a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ResponseBody.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">@ResponseBody</a></code>&nbsp;semantics by default. The value attribute may indicate a suggestion for a logical component name, to be turned into a Spring bean in case of an auto-detected component. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">CONSTRUCTOR and METHOD Java @Annotations</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="@RestController (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RestController.html" target="_blank">@RestController</a> annotated class receives a request, it looks for an appropriate handler method to handle the request. This requires that a controller map each request to a handler method by one or more handler mappings. To do so, a controller class’s methods are decorated with the @RequestMapping annotation, making them handler methods.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For Swagger documentation purposes, the&nbsp;<code><a aria-label="@ApiOperation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X#apioperation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@ApiOperation</a></code> annotation&nbsp;is used to declare a single operation within an API resource. An operation is considered a unique combination of a path and an HTTP method. Only methods that are annotated <code>@ApiOperation</code>&nbsp;will be scanned and added to the API declaration. Some handlers or operations need to ensure data integrity and consistency using the transaction.  </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Transaction management is an essential technique in enterprise applications to ensure data integrity and consistency. Spring supports both programmatic and declarative (<a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.4.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/Transactional.html">@Transactional</a>) transaction management.   </p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">

    public BusinessEntityController(IBusinessEntityRepository businessEntityRepository) {
        this.businessEntityRepository = businessEntityRepository;

    @ApiOperation(value = &quot;Retrieves given entity&quot;, response=BusinessEntityModel.class)
    public ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; get(@Valid @PathVariable Long id){
        checkIfExist(id);

    }

	@Transactional

    @ApiOperation(value = &quot;Creates a new entity&quot;, notes=&quot;The newly created entity Id will be sent in the location response header&quot;)
    public ResponseEntity&lt;Void&gt; create(@Valid @RequestBody BusinessEntityModel newEntity){

        // Set the location header for the newly created resource*/
        return new ResponseEntity &lt;&gt;(null, getHttpHeaders(businessEntityRepository.save(newEntity)), HttpStatus.CREATED);

    }
...
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">Managing transactions pro-grammatically, we have to include transaction management code in each transactional operation (boilerplate code). As a result, the boilerplate transaction code is repeated in each of these operations. In most cases, declarative transaction management is preferable instead of programmatic transactions. It’s achieved by separating transaction management code from our business methods via declarations. This can help us to enable transactions for our applications more easily and define a consistent transaction policy, although declarative transaction management is less flexible than programmatic transaction management. Programmatic transaction management allows us to control transactions through our code [3].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another useful annotation used in a well-designed system is&nbsp;<code>@Autowired.</code> @Autowired can be used at the constructor method to resolve and inject collaborating beans into a bean, leading us to better application design. Applications developed using the principle of separating interface from implementation and the dependency injection pattern are easy to test, both for unit testing and integration testing because that principle and pattern can reduce coupling between different units of our application.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> PARAMETER Java @Annotations </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Besides authentication and authorization, one area of importance in building secure web services is to ensure that inputs are always validated [2]. Java Bean annotations provide mechanisms to implement input validation. We can achieve it by using @Valid annotation in methods parameters. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Our class should validate incoming identifier requests before processing the soft delete. By simply adding the @Valid annotation to the method, Spring will ensure that the incoming identifier requests are run through our defined validation rules first.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
...
  	@Transactional
    @RequestMapping(value = &quot;/businessEntity/{id}&quot;, method = RequestMethod.DELETE, produces = &quot;application/json&quot;)
    @ApiOperation(value = &quot;Deletes given entity&quot;)
    public ResponseEntity&lt;Void&gt; delete(@Valid @PathVariable Long id, @Valid @RequestBody String lastModifiedBy){

        Optional&lt;BusinessEntityModel&gt; softDelete = businessEntityRepository.findByIdAndStatus(id, Status.PUBLISHED.ordinal());
        if (softDelete.isPresent()) {
            BusinessEntityModel afterIsPresent = softDelete.get();
            afterIsPresent.setStatus(Status.UNPUBLISHED.ordinal());
            afterIsPresent.setLastModifiedBy(lastModifiedBy);
            businessEntityRepository.save(afterIsPresent);
            return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.OK);
        }
        else
            throw new ResourceNotFoundException(&quot;Entity with id &quot; + id + &quot; not found&quot;);
    }
...
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">@PathVariable, as well as @RequestParam,  are used to extract values from the HTTP request, there is a subtle difference between them. @RequestParam is used to get the request parameters from URL (<a href="https://www.jeevora.com/">https://www.jeevora.com/</a>&#8230;?id=1), also known as query parameters, while @PathVariable extracts values from URI (<a href="https://www.jeevora.com/">https://www.jeevora.com/</a>id/1) as demonstrated in our case study.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">@RequestBody annotation indicates that a method parameter should be bound to the body of the web request while @ResponseBody indicates a method return value should be bound to the web response body. </p>



<div style="height:36px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Data Access Object</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A typical design mistake is to mix different types of logic (e.g., presentation logic, business logic, and data access logic) in a single large module. This reduces the module’s reusability and maintainability because of the tight coupling it introduces. The general purpose of the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern is to avoid these problems by separating data access logic from business logic and presentation logic. This pattern recommends that data access logic be encapsulated in independent modules called data access objects [3].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Repositories, or Data Access Objects (DAO), provide an abstraction for interacting with data stores. Repositories traditionally include an interface that provides a set of finder methods such as findById, and findAll for retrieving data, and methods to persist and delete data. Repositories also include a class that implements this interface using datastore-specific technologies. It is also customary to have one Repository per domain object. Although this has been a popular approach, there is a lot of boilerplate code that gets duplicated in each repository implementation [1].</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: java; title: ; notranslate">
package com.BusinessEntityManagementSystem.dataAccessObject;

import org.springframework.data.domain.Page;
import org.springframework.data.domain.Pageable;
import org.springframework.data.repository.NoRepositoryBean;
import org.springframework.data.repository.PagingAndSortingRepository;

import java.util.Optional;

@NoRepositoryBean
public interface IGenericRepository&lt;T&gt; extends PagingAndSortingRepository&lt;T, Long&gt; {

    Optional&lt;T&gt; findByIdAndStatus(long id, int status);

    Page&lt;T&gt; findAllByStatus(int status, Pageable pageable);
}
</pre></div>


<p class="has-medium-font-size">With <a aria-label="@NoRepositoryBean (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/NoRepositoryBean.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@NoRepositoryBean</a> annotation, we can use it to exclude repository interfaces from being picked up and thus, in consequence, get an instance created. This will typically be used when providing an extended base interface for all repositories in combination with a custom repository base class to implement methods declared in that intermediate interface. In this case, we typically derive our concrete repository interfaces from the intermediate one but we don&#8217;t want to create a Spring bean for the intermediate interface.</p>



<div style="height:47px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">By the end of this demonstration, we have used the following Java @annotations in our API represented in the table below. It is divided by the target and purpose of each annotation. Sometimes we have cases where some annotations have more than one target, although not all are repeated in the table.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"> Authorization to third parties using the traditional model, where the client accesses a protected resource using the resource owner&#8217;s credentials, has associated with it a number of issues and limitations as the owner will have to share their credentials with third parties [1]:<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>



<ul>
<li>Credentials need to be stored in third-party applications for future use.</li>



<li>Servers will be required to support authentication.</li>



<li>Third-party applications gain access to all protected resources of the resource owner, leaving them unable to restrict the duration or access to a limited subset of resources.</li>



<li>The resource owner cannot revoke access to a third party without revoking access to all others and this is only possible by changing the password.</li>



<li>The security breach in third-party applications results in the exposure of credentials and all data protected by the third party.</li>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The problems and limitations identified in the traditional authorization model are addressed by this standard by introducing the authorization layer, separating the role of the client from the resource owner. The client requests access to resources owned by the resource owner hosted on the resource server and different credentials are issued than those of the resource owner. Instead of using the resource owner&#8217;s credentials to access protected resources, the client obtains an access token that indicates a specific scope, time, and other access attributes, which tokens are issued with the approval of the resource owner. The client uses the access token to access protected resources hosted by the resource server (Figure 1) [1]. <gwmw style="display:none;"><gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw><gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></gwmw></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">OpenID Connect<gwmw style="display:none;"><gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></gwmw></h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">OpenID Connect builds on top of OAuth2 and adds authentication. OpenID Connect adds some constraints to OAuth2 like UserInfo Endpoint, ID Token, discovery and dynamic registration of OpenID Connect providers, and session management.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">OpenID Connect allows clients of all types, including Web-based, mobile, and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The specification suite is extensible, allowing participants to use optional features such as the encryption of identity data, the discovery of OpenID Providers, and session management.<gwmw style="display:none;"><gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></gwmw></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Microservices Security Mechanisms &#8211; Token-based</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">On the other hand, Token-based authorization is less complex and unlike OAuth is not a standard.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The client accesses the server by sending the access credentials, the service provider validates the credentials, saves an authorization token on success, associates the token with the client address, and assigns the lifetime of this access token. The service sends a success message to the customer along with the token. The client starts to invoke the services on the server by sending the authorization token, where the server will validate each request, checking if the token is valid (Figure 2).<gwmw style="display:none;"><gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></gwmw></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">JWToken</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">JWT tokens are JSON-encoded data structures that contain information about the issuer, subject (claims), expiration time, access token, refresh token, id token, and so on. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is signed for tamper proof and authenticity and it can be encrypted to protect the token information using a symmetric or asymmetric approach. JWT is simpler than SAML 1.1/2.0 and supported by all devices</p>
