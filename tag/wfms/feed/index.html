<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">Traditionally, systems are designed and implemented not only by procedural codes but also by the processing logic performed by the application, expressed as workflow. Having a system where business logic is implemented using procedural or functional codes has consequences, wherein increasing complexity and demand to adapt them to new requirements, any process modification requires code modification. In this case, the code will need to be modified, tested, and maintained, so each modification consumes considerable resources. Using <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/28/process-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workflow systems</a> facilitates the task of modifying business logic, as one can visually perceive the impact of changes and no need to change functional code.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">

Integrated Workflow Systems

</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a result, software systems increasingly integrate a workflow component that facilitates <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/30/business-process-modeling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business process modelin</a>g. These components are not autonomous systems, they are incorporated into the application, known as Integrated Workflow Systems (Figure 1), which consist of activities and their causal and temporal ordering, performed by a common system [1],[2].</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="490" height="462" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFIntegrated.png" alt="Workflow" class="wp-image-281" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFIntegrated.png 490w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFIntegrated-300x283.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1: Conceptual architecture of integrated WfMS [1], [2].</figcaption></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Independent Workflow Systems </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If there is more than one system, the so-called application-independent workflow system (Figure 2) arises, it is nothing more than dedicated <a aria-label="WfMS (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.wfmc.org/2-uncategorised/53-reference-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WfMS</a>, which ensures the invocation of applications as specified in the process model, as well as the transfer between these systems [1], [2]. It interacts with other applications such as ERP, inventory manager, and others, playing a driving role in the exchange of information between them, managing all the logic within organizations.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">The three functional areas of workflow systems were proposed by the <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/28/process-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WfMC </a>reference model, which describes a common model for building workflow systems. So, the <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/28/process-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WfMC </a>reference model identifies the relationship between the various alternative implementation approaches [1] as, <strong>Build time functions; Run-time Control Functions; Run-time Interactions.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1212" height="878" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFCaracteristics.png" alt="Workflow Systems - Characteristics of workflow systems in construction and execution" class="wp-image-290" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFCaracteristics.png 1212w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFCaracteristics-300x217.png 300w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFCaracteristics-768x556.png 768w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFCaracteristics-1024x742.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1212px) 100vw, 1212px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Figure 1: Characteristics of workflow systems in construction and execution [2].</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a result, these areas can be divided into two main sections. The construction and execution time. Therefore the <strong>construction time</strong> includes operations such as process design, giving rise to a visual model and process definitions. On the other hand, the execution time is related to process instantiation, control, and interaction with end-users.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Above all, these three main functional areas of a workflow system range from the<a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/30/business-process-modeling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> process model</a> to human resources in organizations that leverage this kind of system.</p>



<p>Table 1: WfMS Functional Areas [1].  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table has-fixed-layout is-style-regular"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Functional Areas</strong>                       </td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Build time functions</td><td>During this phase, a business process is translated from the real world into a formal definition (called a process model, process metadata, or a process definition) that is computer understood by using one or more analysis techniques, modeling, and system definition.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></td></tr><tr><td>Run-time Control Functions                                                                               </td><td>At run-time, process definition is interpreted by the workflow engine, a core component of a WfMS, responsible for creating and controlling process instances, scheduling activities within the process, and invoking the appropriate HR and IT resources.</td></tr><tr><td>Run-time Interactions</td><td>Interaction with the workflow engine is necessary for transferring control between activities, checking the status of process operations, invoking tools, and transferring the appropriate data to the processing system.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:65px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Workflow Enactment Service</strong> </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Therefore Workflow Enactment Service is the center of all interactions in process automation. This is typically a service consisting of one or more workflow engines for creating, managing, and running workflow instances. Consequently, it can be considered as a state transition machine where process instances or individual activities modify states in response to external events or specific control decisions made by a workflow engine [1]. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Execution states  for process instances </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The execution states of these transitions in process instances have different designations as described below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1120" height="506" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionState.png" alt="Workflow Systems - Example execution states for process instances in state transitions" class="wp-image-291" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionState.png 1120w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionState-300x136.png 300w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionState-768x347.png 768w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionState-1024x463.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Figure 2: Example execution states for process instances in state transitions [1]. </figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The transition should occur either in response to events or as a result of transition conditions within the process definition, and may be in the following execution states [1]:</p>



<p> Table 2: Possible execution states of a process instance [1].  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table has-fixed-layout is-style-regular"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Execution State</strong></td><td><strong> Description </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Started</td><td>We create a process instance, including process state properties and relevant workflow data, but it still not meeting the conditions for it to start execution.</td></tr><tr><td> Running</td><td>The process instance has started running and any of its activities can be started</td></tr><tr><td> Active</td><td>One or more stream activities have started.</td></tr><tr><td> Suspended</td><td>The process instance is paused and no activity is started until the process has returned to the running state.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></td></tr><tr><td> Complete</td><td>The process instance fulfills the conditions for completion and the instance may be destroyed.</td></tr><tr><td> Finished</td><td>Process instance execution was interrupted before normal completion and the instance could be destroyed</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Execution states  for activity instances  </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sometimes there is a need to suspend or terminate a particular activity running within a process instance. This may not be possible, as there may be tasks still to be done within the activity. Therefore, only after the activity has finished the tasks and already with the process instance returned to a running state [1], it is possible to suspend or terminate a certain activity.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/28/process-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WfMC </a>to address this problem has created unique run-time state transition patterns for activity instances, different from process instances. Therefore, if there is a need to suspend or terminate an activity, simply activate one of the execution states for the activities. Thus, workflow execution can have execution state information for process instances as well as for activity instances even though the activities are within a process.</p>



<p> Table 3: Possible execution states of an activity instance [1].  </p>

<figure class="wp-block-table has-fixed-layout"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong> Execution State </strong></td><td><strong> Description </strong><gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></td></tr><tr><td>Inactive</td><td>The activity within the instance was created but was not activated having any items to process<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></td></tr><tr><td>Active </td><td>An item was created and assigned to the activity instance for processing.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></td></tr><tr><td>Suspended</td><td>The instance has been paused and an item will not be allocated for processing until it returns to the running state. </td></tr><tr><td>Completed   </td><td>Instance execution has been completed.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">Process automation can be approached from different perspectives and may refer to the intention to automate any conceivable part of procedural work within a business process [1]. This ranges from simple operations that are part of a single process activity to coordinating automated whole and complex processes [2].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> This intention to automate any conceivable part of procedural work leads to the Workflow concept. Workflow is understood as a process that is fully or partially automated by software, which transmits information from one participant to another according to the time and logic defined in the underlying process model [2].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> This post addresses key concepts associated with process automation from the definition of a workflow to the presentation of its concepts and characteristics.  </p>



<div style="height:64px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Process Automation &#8211; Historical retrospective</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before going into detail about the concept, it is important to make a temporal survey to fit the concept with the current reality, as well as understand the origins and emergence of this “new” approach in the world of organizations and IT.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Thus, in the 1990s arose the <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wfmc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Workflow Management Collation</a> (WfMC)</strong>, was founded to set standards related to workflows, it was created by IT and business companies, as well as users and academics. This organization felt the need to define and standardize the term Workflow Management System (WfMS), understanding it as a system that defines, creates, and manages the execution of workflows through the use of software, capable of interpreting the process, interacting with participants as well as when necessary to invoke the use of IT tools and applications [3], [4].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Looking back, it can be seen that over the years there have been several milestones around the development of information systems. From a historical summary, the following stand out [5]:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>1965-1975</em></strong>: <strong>the decomposition of applications</strong>, which comprised applications separated by layers, unlike previous monolithic applications, each with its own databases and definitions;</li>



<li><em><strong>1975-1985</strong></em>: <strong>database management</strong>, removal of data management from the application, increasing by large scale the emergence of DBMS;</li>



<li><strong><em>1985-1995</em></strong>: <strong>user interface</strong>, removal of  interface management from  applications; </li>



<li><strong><em>1995-2005</em></strong>: <strong>workflow</strong>, the removal of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="business processes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_automation" target="_blank">business processes</a> from applications.</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Given the evolution of information systems in recent decades, especially with the removal of business processes from within applications, [5] W. M. P. Van Der Aalst et al makes an analogy, comparing WfMS to DBMS, in the sense that just as databases are developed and used with the help of DBMS, WfMS can also be used to define and use workflow systems.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>



<div style="height:61px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Process Automation &#8211; Workflow Definition<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The term workflow, which is the focus of WfMS, is often placed in the relationship of dependency between process management and analysis, and can also be understood as the way workflows through the process, the activities that are performed on it, the people involved, and the information necessary for their conclusion.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is common to find references to process management as workflow management and information systems that support workflow management as being called WfMS [6]. The term workflow management is often referred to as being the controller of actions taken on documents moving through a business process. Specifically, WfMS is used to determine and control who can access which document, what operations employees can perform on a given document, which sequence of operations are performed [6], and is able to integrate between a set of systems. Similarly, these can also be used to implement business processes in which people are actively involved, thereby improving collaboration between stakeholders [4], [3] and systematization in the sense that all workers can perform a task following the same steps previously modeled.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the face of new needs, this type of system has been and is subject to the constant insertion of new features, making it flexible so that it can cope with the increasing complexity of modern processes. Due to this scope and the expansion of flexibility, it has evolved to incorporate more capabilities and is no longer focused solely on process automation. In the present times, it is common to find references to WfMS as Business Process Management Systems (BPMS). WfMS is understood to be the embryo of BPMS. It is also important to highlight that currently the term WfMS is little used and ends up falling out in favor of BPMS, which is the natural evolution of it.</p>



<div style="height:63px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Process Automation &#8211; Workflow basics</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> After the definition and historical retrospective, it is already possible to understand a little more about the term workflow and the associated technologies. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is now pertinent to present some key concepts and descriptions, defined by the WfMC [7]: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Activity  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.jeevora.com/2019/08/04/three-functional-areas-of-workflow-systems/" target="_blank">Activity </a></strong>&#8211; Set of events that occur under the responsibility of an actor;</li>



<li><strong>Deadline</strong> &#8211; Based on the wait time each rule in an activity or to-do list needs to complete its goals;</li>



<li><strong>Event </strong>&#8211; Occurrence of a condition causing one or more actions within the system;</li>



<li><strong>Trigger </strong>&#8211; Allows the awakening of activity from an event;</li>



<li><strong>Instance </strong>&#8211; Represents association or addition of data to a particular phase of a process or activity;</li>
