										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Knowing the different techniques for scaling databases, help us to choose the appropriate strategy to adapt to our needs and propose.</p>



<p>Hence, in this post, we will demonstrate different solutions and techniques for scaling databases server.  They are divided between reading and writing strategies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reading/Loading</h2>



<p>Sometimes we have applications that are under so much <a href="https://jailsonevora.com/2019/09/16/key-java-annotations-to-build-spring-boot-rest-api/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">load</a>. And to deal with this issue, we demonstrate three different <a href="https://jailsonevora.com/2019/08/10/java-ee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">techniques </a>that we can implement. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Databases scaling &#8211; Caching</h3>



<p>Caching technique stores frequently requested data or expensive computing operations responses in temporary memory. The data stored in the cache needs to be changed by the nature of the application, and to update them, the cache <strong>invalidation and eviction</strong> technique can be used to maintain the consistency of the data. It can be achieved with the cache expired time to live (<strong>TTL</strong>) method or others dependent on the caching patterns used.</p>



<p>Different caching patterns can be used as a strategy to implement caching solutions. <strong>Caching aside </strong>supports heavy reads and works even if the cache goes down. <strong>Read-through </strong>and <strong>Write-through</strong> are used together. They are great alternatives for read-heavy workloads but cache failure results in system failure. Write-back is useful for writing heavy workloads, and it is used by various DBMS implementations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://documents.lucid.app/documents/5f2ed513-1fa5-4d6e-91bd-b7f69e3433e3/pages/0_0?a=1757&amp;x=-464&amp;y=2197&amp;w=967&amp;h=444&amp;store=1&amp;accept=image%2F*&amp;auth=LCA%20cc33cf943beff34aa1a6e56ca3c8228b33a0eaa1862c62d5cc5779666b82e332-ts%3D1688291822" alt="Scaling Databases Database caching" width="723" height="333"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Database caching</figcaption></figure>



<p>Depending on the requirements such as heavy reading or heavy writing or a mix of both, we can decide which pattern to use in a way that we can afford cache or database failure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Databases scaling &#8211; Replication</h3>



<p>Replication works with having one database referred to as <strong>main</strong> where all the writing request flow to it. In addition, we make an exact copy of that main database as new node replicas known as <strong>secondary, </strong>responsible only for dealing with the reading requests. The main database constantly feeds the slaves nodes with more recent data keeping our information consistent between all the nodes in the cluster.</p>



<p>Replication is a great strategy to deal with fault tolerance and maintain the CAP theorem and system scalability. Suppose one of the nodes goes down, we continue to serve as we have the same data replicated in the other nodes. Also in a cluster, a node can take over and become a main database in case of primary node failure. Replication also helps reduce latency in the application, once we can have our database deployed and data replicated on different regions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDN</a> and it can be accessed easily by the local users.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://documents.lucid.app/documents/5f2ed513-1fa5-4d6e-91bd-b7f69e3433e3/pages/0_0?a=1602&amp;x=-314&amp;y=1336&amp;w=747&amp;h=528&amp;store=1&amp;accept=image%2F*&amp;auth=LCA%2062b5a257e06bc3e4a98457d2a2f2a475e428f0a6c74f2bb5bff089c27c6a12a6-ts%3D1688291822" alt="Scaling Databases Database replication technique" width="560" height="396"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Database replication technique</figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Synchronous and asynchronous</h4>



<p>Besides those advantages, maintaining consistency in the replica node, became complicated with the increase of the nodes.  This problem can be solved using a <strong>synchronous </strong>or <strong>asynchronous </strong>replication strategy depending on the requirements.</p>



<p>The synchronous strategy has the advantage of the <strong><em>lag </em></strong><em>being</em><strong><em> zero</em></strong>, and the data is always consistent, but as a downside, the performance is affected once it is necessary to wait till all the replicas are updated and acknowledged by the issuer. On the other hand, in the asynchronous strategy, the writes became faster as the main node does not wait for the acknowledgment, but rise the problem of an inconsistent state if a replica fails to update the value.</p>



<p>Bear in mind that there is no silver bullet, the best strategy depends on our needs. A trade-off must be assumed between consistency, availability, or partition (<strong>CAP Theorem</strong>). The CAP theorem state that we can guarantee only two of them at a time.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Databases scaling &#8211; Indexing</h3>



<p>Indexing is used to locate and quickly access data, improving the performance of database activity. A database table can have one or more indexes associated with it.</p>



<p>Indexing improves query performance with faster data retrieval, it enhances data access efficiency, decreasing the number of I/O for retrieving the data. It optimizes data sorting since the database does not need to sort the entire table and instead only the relevant rows. Indexing maintains the data consistent even with the rise in the amount of data. Also, indexing ensures database integrity, avoiding storing duplicated data.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="461" height="315" src="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/secondary-level-of-index.png" alt="Secondary indexing example" class="wp-image-3008" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/secondary-level-of-index.png 461w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/secondary-level-of-index-300x205.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Secondary indexing example</figcaption></figure>



<p>As a drawback, indexing needs more storage which increases the database size. It also increases the maintenance overhead with addition, removal, and modifications in the table. Indexing can reduce performance in insert and update. Choosing an index can be difficult for a specific query or application.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Writing</h2>



<p>For applications that have a lot of writing to the database with the users constantly harming it with new data, we have sharding and NoSQL as strategies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Databases scaling &#8211; Sharding</h3>



<p>Sharding or data partition allows the separation of large databases data into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts, splitting the database into multiple main databases. There are two kinds of sharding, <strong>vertical</strong> and <strong>horizontal</strong>.</p>



<p>The data partition has the advantage of query optimization bringing a better performance and reducing latency. It allows the possibility to have users&#8217; data across different locations that can be accessed faster for users in particular regions. Also, it has the advantage of avoiding a single point o failure.</p>



<p>One of the drawbacks of sharding is partition overloaded in case we did not distribute the data across the partition correctly. Depending on the strategy we choose, we can end up with some partitions with a lot of data and some with fewer data, and the query on that large partition can become slower. Another disadvantage is to come back and recover the prior state of the no-sharding strategy once it was implemented and the data split across different databases.</p>



<p>The application of partition can be logical or physical. A logical sharding is when we have a different subset of the data in the same physical machine, and a physical sharding can have more than one subset of partitions in a physical machine.</p>



<p>For partitioning the data, we can choose between algorithm sharding or dynamic sharding. There exist different algorithms and dynamic sharding technics since <strong>key-based</strong>, <strong>range-based</strong>, and <strong>directory-based </strong>sharding as the most used.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Vertical sharding</h4>



<p>For vertical sharding, we take each table and put them on a different machine. Such as user tables, log tables, or comment tables, each on different machines. Vertical sharding is effective when queries tend to return only a subset of columns of the data. For example, if some queries request only names, and others request only addresses, then the names and addresses can be sharded onto separate servers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://documents.lucid.app/documents/277d215c-f0a3-4a28-ae60-66c3c69505e6/pages/0_0?a=771&amp;x=225&amp;y=-693&amp;w=1215&amp;h=1166&amp;store=1&amp;accept=image%2F*&amp;auth=LCA%20fb27ba4f300f942027f6cb5a7cba40202875a1d57f4920dd1dd1ffec951d41e9-ts%3D1688312868" alt="Scaling Databases Vertical sharding" width="608" height="583"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Vertical sharding</figcaption></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Horizontal sharding</h4>



<p>In case we have a single table that is became very large, we apply horizontal sharding. We take a single table and split a chunk of related data across multiple machines. Horizontal sharding is effective when queries tend to return a subset of rows that are often grouped. For example, queries that filter data based on short date ranges are ideal for horizontal sharding, since the date range will necessarily limit querying to only a subset of the servers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://documents.lucid.app/documents/cb19946c-e312-4df4-9912-e5fa677fd39f/pages/0_0?a=281&amp;x=-419&amp;y=-228&amp;w=1738&amp;h=1057&amp;store=1&amp;accept=image%2F*&amp;auth=LCA%20b4f87973d8c846c410b55803e5402d5837b6da85bb6fe776185b116d883a3f4b-ts%3D1688299021" alt="Horizontal sharding" width="869" height="529"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Horizontal sharding</figcaption></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Databases scaling &#8211; No SQL</h3>



<p>No SQl is not a relational database and essentially is a key-value pair. A key-value pair models are naturally able to scale easily by themselves across multiple different machines. NoSQL is classified into four main categories, <strong>Column-oriented</strong> which stores data as column families, <strong>Graph </strong>stores data as nodes and edges, <strong>Key-Value</strong> stores data as key-value pairs and <strong>Document </strong>stores data as semi-structured documents. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://documents.lucid.app/documents/5f2ed513-1fa5-4d6e-91bd-b7f69e3433e3/pages/0_0?a=563&amp;x=-549&amp;y=108&amp;w=1078&amp;h=1144&amp;store=1&amp;accept=image%2F*&amp;auth=LCA%201b0fc458cc8da4c839c83deded43ac4c6e6d72728d1b5d716317f0cc236d22f1-ts%3D1688291822" alt="Scaling Databases NoSQL database categories" width="787" height="858"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">NoSQL database categories</figcaption></figure>



<p>It allows <strong>dynamic</strong> <strong>schema</strong> which can accommodate changes without schema alterations. Also, it provides <strong>horizontal</strong> <strong>scalability</strong> since it was designed to scale out by adding more nodes to a database cluster. It is also designed for <strong>high availability</strong> to handle node failures automatically and data replication across multiple nodes in the cluster.</p>



<p>This no-relational database offers several benefits over relational databases, such as <strong>scalability</strong>, <strong>flexibility</strong>, and <strong>cost-effectiveness</strong>. However, they also have several drawbacks, such as a lack of <strong>standardization</strong>, lack of <strong>ACID</strong> <strong>compliance</strong>, and lack of support for <strong>complex queries</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>In this article, we demonstrated strategies to be implemented when dealing with database scalability. </p>



<p>We split it between reading and writing strategies. For reading, we can apply different <strong>caching</strong> mechanisms, <strong>replication</strong> with primary and secondary databases as well as implement indexing to locate and quickly access the data. For writing scalability there are sharding or NoSQl strategies, both with their advantages and drawback. </p>



<p>Finally, bear in mind that there are no perfect solutions, we need to understand our requirements and apply trade-offs to choose the best strategies for our application. </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">Traditionally, systems are designed and implemented not only by procedural codes but also by the processing logic performed by the application, expressed as workflow. Having a system where business logic is implemented using procedural or functional codes has consequences, wherein increasing complexity and demand to adapt them to new requirements, any process modification requires code modification. In this case, the code will need to be modified, tested, and maintained, so each modification consumes considerable resources. Using <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/28/process-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workflow systems</a> facilitates the task of modifying business logic, as one can visually perceive the impact of changes and no need to change functional code.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">

Integrated Workflow Systems

</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a result, software systems increasingly integrate a workflow component that facilitates <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/30/business-process-modeling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business process modelin</a>g. These components are not autonomous systems, they are incorporated into the application, known as Integrated Workflow Systems (Figure 1), which consist of activities and their causal and temporal ordering, performed by a common system [1],[2].</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Independent Workflow Systems </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If there is more than one system, the so-called application-independent workflow system (Figure 2) arises, it is nothing more than dedicated <a aria-label="WfMS (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.wfmc.org/2-uncategorised/53-reference-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WfMS</a>, which ensures the invocation of applications as specified in the process model, as well as the transfer between these systems [1], [2]. It interacts with other applications such as ERP, inventory manager, and others, playing a driving role in the exchange of information between them, managing all the logic within organizations.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">Process automation can be approached from different perspectives and may refer to the intention to automate any conceivable part of procedural work within a business process [1]. This ranges from simple operations that are part of a single process activity to coordinating automated whole and complex processes [2].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> This intention to automate any conceivable part of procedural work leads to the Workflow concept. Workflow is understood as a process that is fully or partially automated by software, which transmits information from one participant to another according to the time and logic defined in the underlying process model [2].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> This post addresses key concepts associated with process automation from the definition of a workflow to the presentation of its concepts and characteristics.  </p>



<div style="height:64px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Process Automation &#8211; Historical retrospective</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before going into detail about the concept, it is important to make a temporal survey to fit the concept with the current reality, as well as understand the origins and emergence of this “new” approach in the world of organizations and IT.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Thus, in the 1990s arose the <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wfmc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Workflow Management Collation</a> (WfMC)</strong>, was founded to set standards related to workflows, it was created by IT and business companies, as well as users and academics. This organization felt the need to define and standardize the term Workflow Management System (WfMS), understanding it as a system that defines, creates, and manages the execution of workflows through the use of software, capable of interpreting the process, interacting with participants as well as when necessary to invoke the use of IT tools and applications [3], [4].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Looking back, it can be seen that over the years there have been several milestones around the development of information systems. From a historical summary, the following stand out [5]:</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Given the evolution of information systems in recent decades, especially with the removal of business processes from within applications, [5] W. M. P. Van Der Aalst et al makes an analogy, comparing WfMS to DBMS, in the sense that just as databases are developed and used with the help of DBMS, WfMS can also be used to define and use workflow systems.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Process Automation &#8211; Workflow Definition<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The term workflow, which is the focus of WfMS, is often placed in the relationship of dependency between process management and analysis, and can also be understood as the way workflows through the process, the activities that are performed on it, the people involved, and the information necessary for their conclusion.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is common to find references to process management as workflow management and information systems that support workflow management as being called WfMS [6]. The term workflow management is often referred to as being the controller of actions taken on documents moving through a business process. Specifically, WfMS is used to determine and control who can access which document, what operations employees can perform on a given document, which sequence of operations are performed [6], and is able to integrate between a set of systems. Similarly, these can also be used to implement business processes in which people are actively involved, thereby improving collaboration between stakeholders [4], [3] and systematization in the sense that all workers can perform a task following the same steps previously modeled.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the face of new needs, this type of system has been and is subject to the constant insertion of new features, making it flexible so that it can cope with the increasing complexity of modern processes. Due to this scope and the expansion of flexibility, it has evolved to incorporate more capabilities and is no longer focused solely on process automation. In the present times, it is common to find references to WfMS as Business Process Management Systems (BPMS). WfMS is understood to be the embryo of BPMS. It is also important to highlight that currently the term WfMS is little used and ends up falling out in favor of BPMS, which is the natural evolution of it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Process Automation &#8211; Workflow basics</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> After the definition and historical retrospective, it is already possible to understand a little more about the term workflow and the associated technologies. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is now pertinent to present some key concepts and descriptions, defined by the WfMC [7]: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Activity  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.jeevora.com/2019/08/04/three-functional-areas-of-workflow-systems/" target="_blank">Activity </a></strong>&#8211; Set of events that occur under the responsibility of an actor;</li>



<li><strong>Deadline</strong> &#8211; Based on the wait time each rule in an activity or to-do list needs to complete its goals;</li>



<li><strong>Event </strong>&#8211; Occurrence of a condition causing one or more actions within the system;</li>



<li><strong>Trigger </strong>&#8211; Allows the awakening of activity from an event;</li>



<li><strong>Instance </strong>&#8211; Represents association or addition of data to a particular phase of a process or activity;</li>



<li><strong>Task List </strong>&#8211; Associated to a participant, or group of participants in a workflow, who can share a common list;</li>



<li><strong>Role </strong>&#8211; Actors who have qualifications and rights that enable them to perform an activity;</li>



<li><strong>Participant </strong>&#8211; Resource that performs the work represented by an activity instance, which may be human, equipment, rules, or an organizational unit;</li>



<li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.jeevora.com/2019/07/30/business-process-modeling/" target="_blank">Process </a></strong>&#8211; A set of procedures or activities related to the goal of achieving a goal within an organizational context;</li>



<li><strong>Timing</strong>&#8211; Formal representation of the interaction of activities, establishing the dependency between them, and specifying which tasks should be performed in parallel, or which may be delayed until another activity is completed;</li>



<li><strong>Task </strong>&#8211; Represents the work done by a participant in a process instance within the context of workflows;</li>



<li><strong>Transition </strong>&#8211;  the process or a period of changing from one state to the other. </li>
</ul>
