<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">Traditionally, systems are designed and implemented not only by procedural codes but also by the processing logic performed by the application, expressed as workflow. Having a system where business logic is implemented using procedural or functional codes has consequences, wherein increasing complexity and demand to adapt them to new requirements, any process modification requires code modification. In this case, the code will need to be modified, tested, and maintained, so each modification consumes considerable resources. Using <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/28/process-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workflow systems</a> facilitates the task of modifying business logic, as one can visually perceive the impact of changes and no need to change functional code.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">

Integrated Workflow Systems

</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a result, software systems increasingly integrate a workflow component that facilitates <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/30/business-process-modeling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business process modelin</a>g. These components are not autonomous systems, they are incorporated into the application, known as Integrated Workflow Systems (Figure 1), which consist of activities and their causal and temporal ordering, performed by a common system [1],[2].</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="490" height="462" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFIntegrated.png" alt="Workflow" class="wp-image-281" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFIntegrated.png 490w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFIntegrated-300x283.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1: Conceptual architecture of integrated WfMS [1], [2].</figcaption></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Independent Workflow Systems </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If there is more than one system, the so-called application-independent workflow system (Figure 2) arises, it is nothing more than dedicated <a aria-label="WfMS (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.wfmc.org/2-uncategorised/53-reference-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WfMS</a>, which ensures the invocation of applications as specified in the process model, as well as the transfer between these systems [1], [2]. It interacts with other applications such as ERP, inventory manager, and others, playing a driving role in the exchange of information between them, managing all the logic within organizations.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">The three functional areas of workflow systems were proposed by the <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/28/process-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WfMC </a>reference model, which describes a common model for building workflow systems. So, the <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/28/process-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WfMC </a>reference model identifies the relationship between the various alternative implementation approaches [1] as, <strong>Build time functions; Run-time Control Functions; Run-time Interactions.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1212" height="878" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFCaracteristics.png" alt="Workflow Systems - Characteristics of workflow systems in construction and execution" class="wp-image-290" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFCaracteristics.png 1212w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFCaracteristics-300x217.png 300w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFCaracteristics-768x556.png 768w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFCaracteristics-1024x742.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1212px) 100vw, 1212px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Figure 1: Characteristics of workflow systems in construction and execution [2].</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a result, these areas can be divided into two main sections. The construction and execution time. Therefore the <strong>construction time</strong> includes operations such as process design, giving rise to a visual model and process definitions. On the other hand, the execution time is related to process instantiation, control, and interaction with end-users.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Above all, these three main functional areas of a workflow system range from the<a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/30/business-process-modeling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> process model</a> to human resources in organizations that leverage this kind of system.</p>



<p>Table 1: WfMS Functional Areas [1].  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table has-fixed-layout is-style-regular"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Functional Areas</strong>                       </td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Build time functions</td><td>During this phase, a business process is translated from the real world into a formal definition (called a process model, process metadata, or a process definition) that is computer understood by using one or more analysis techniques, modeling, and system definition.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></td></tr><tr><td>Run-time Control Functions                                                                               </td><td>At run-time, process definition is interpreted by the workflow engine, a core component of a WfMS, responsible for creating and controlling process instances, scheduling activities within the process, and invoking the appropriate HR and IT resources.</td></tr><tr><td>Run-time Interactions</td><td>Interaction with the workflow engine is necessary for transferring control between activities, checking the status of process operations, invoking tools, and transferring the appropriate data to the processing system.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<div style="height:65px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Workflow Enactment Service</strong> </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Therefore Workflow Enactment Service is the center of all interactions in process automation. This is typically a service consisting of one or more workflow engines for creating, managing, and running workflow instances. Consequently, it can be considered as a state transition machine where process instances or individual activities modify states in response to external events or specific control decisions made by a workflow engine [1]. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Execution states  for process instances </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The execution states of these transitions in process instances have different designations as described below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1120" height="506" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionState.png" alt="Workflow Systems - Example execution states for process instances in state transitions" class="wp-image-291" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionState.png 1120w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionState-300x136.png 300w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionState-768x347.png 768w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionState-1024x463.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Figure 2: Example execution states for process instances in state transitions [1]. </figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The transition should occur either in response to events or as a result of transition conditions within the process definition, and may be in the following execution states [1]:</p>



<p> Table 2: Possible execution states of a process instance [1].  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table has-fixed-layout is-style-regular"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Execution State</strong></td><td><strong> Description </strong></td></tr><tr><td>Started</td><td>We create a process instance, including process state properties and relevant workflow data, but it still not meeting the conditions for it to start execution.</td></tr><tr><td> Running</td><td>The process instance has started running and any of its activities can be started</td></tr><tr><td> Active</td><td>One or more stream activities have started.</td></tr><tr><td> Suspended</td><td>The process instance is paused and no activity is started until the process has returned to the running state.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></td></tr><tr><td> Complete</td><td>The process instance fulfills the conditions for completion and the instance may be destroyed.</td></tr><tr><td> Finished</td><td>Process instance execution was interrupted before normal completion and the instance could be destroyed</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Execution states  for activity instances  </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Sometimes there is a need to suspend or terminate a particular activity running within a process instance. This may not be possible, as there may be tasks still to be done within the activity. Therefore, only after the activity has finished the tasks and already with the process instance returned to a running state [1], it is possible to suspend or terminate a certain activity.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, <a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/28/process-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WfMC </a>to address this problem has created unique run-time state transition patterns for activity instances, different from process instances. Therefore, if there is a need to suspend or terminate an activity, simply activate one of the execution states for the activities. Thus, workflow execution can have execution state information for process instances as well as for activity instances even though the activities are within a process.</p>



<p> Table 3: Possible execution states of an activity instance [1].  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1077" height="306" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionStateToAtivities.png" alt="Workflow Systems - Example execution states for activity instances in state transitions" class="wp-image-292" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionStateToAtivities.png 1077w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionStateToAtivities-300x85.png 300w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionStateToAtivities-768x218.png 768w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WFExecitionStateToAtivities-1024x291.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1077px) 100vw, 1077px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> Figure 3: Example execution states for activity instances in state transitions [1]. </figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-table has-fixed-layout"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong> Execution State </strong></td><td><strong> Description </strong><gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></td></tr><tr><td>Inactive</td><td>The activity within the instance was created but was not activated having any items to process<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></td></tr><tr><td>Active </td><td>An item was created and assigned to the activity instance for processing.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></td></tr><tr><td>Suspended</td><td>The instance has been paused and an item will not be allocated for processing until it returns to the running state. </td></tr><tr><td>Completed   </td><td>Instance execution has been completed.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">Business Process Modeling &#8211; In organizations and IT, the process can often be understood as a limited set of activities that are performed in response to an event, to generate output [1] and can be very simple or extremely complex [2]. It is a somewhat more ambiguous concept with different meanings, depending on the context in which it is used [3].<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Thus, when contextualizing within organizations and IT, it is important to understand that having an input event be turned into output is often referred to as a simple transformation model. This simple transformation model forms the basis for the so-called process view of an organization. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">At first glance, this simplistic model hides the details of the transformation, so it is necessary to achieve a detailed analysis and design, needing to go beyond, entering the so-called “black box”, to be able to know the types of processes, the hierarchies and the determinants of the highlighted architecture (Figure 2) [3].</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="629" height="176" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3.png" alt="Business Process Modeling - Process transformation model" class="wp-image-237" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3.png 629w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1: Process transformation model</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The transformation model receives input and in the “black box” the transformations are performed for an indefinite number of tasks or activities, eventually triggering the output of the transformations performed by the process, as previously mentioned in the process definition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Different kinds of processes </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">That alone is not enough to understand the full meaning and constitution of a process, so by exploring in more detail the constitution of the “black box”, it turns out that it can be constituted by different types of processes, where they are often divided into three different types  [3], [4]: </p>



<ul>
<li>the<strong> individual</strong> ends up being performed by separate individuals; </li>



<li><strong>vertical or functional processes</strong> that are contained within a given functional unit; </li>



<li>and finally, <strong>horizontal functional processes</strong>, which cross several units.</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Equally importantly, process structures can be characterized into five main components or elements, <strong>inputs and outputs, flow units, activity network, and buffers, resources, and information structure</strong>.</p>



<div style="height:67px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Business Process </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The term business can be understood as an organizational entity that inserts resources to provide customers with the desired products or services, encompassing companies and others. Thus, a business process (BP) describes how something is done in an organization [3]. This can be thought of as a set of short or long-term activities, invoked in a specific sequence to achieve a specific business objective [5], [6], [7], involving steps performed by machines and people [8], [9]</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Exploring the concept applied to IT, a metalanguage is often used to describe a business process and may invoke other support services or contain other service components such as state machines, human tasks, business rules, or business map data [9].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Therefore, just as business processes have their principles and concepts, it is important to make a separation between <strong>business processes</strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.jailsonevora.com/2019/07/28/process-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workflows</a></strong>. It is common to encounter confusion around these two concepts. <strong>BP </strong>should not be confused with the workflow. <strong>Workflow </strong>is the way work is done, being dependent on business process support, yet driven by process logic and orchestration rules [9].<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>



<div style="height:68px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"> Business Process Modeling </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In process modeling, there is a specific discipline known as <strong>Business Process Modeling (BPModeling)</strong>. This is understood as the discipline that defines and outlines business practices, processes [10], information flows, and data storage [9], [11]. <gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It involves using a notation such as <strong>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</strong> or <strong>Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)</strong> to capture graphical representations of key processes, workflows, and other aspects related to business logic. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Its main objective is to develop the process model, which will define the existing process flow in detail, and it will be necessary to answer the following questions in its implementation [7]:</p>



<ul>
<li>What is the result of the business process?</li>



<li>What activities are performed within the business process?</li>



<li>What is the order of activities?</li>



<li>Who performs the activities?</li>



<li>What documents are exchanged within the process?</li>



<li>What are the weaknesses of the process, and how can it be extended in the future?</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">  Traits for a good model  </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keeping in mind these issues outlined in the specification, it is crucial to ensure the following traits to list, to obtain a good model. It is recommended that the template be [12]:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Salient</strong>&#8211; should selectively represent aspects relevant to the task at hand;</li>



<li> <strong>Accurate </strong>&#8211; must accurately systematize the current state of affairs and avoid erroneous or biased views;</li>



<li><strong>Complete yet cautious</strong> &#8211; as simple as possible;</li>



<li><strong>Understandable </strong>&#8211; Once you perceive the model, you must be able to understand it.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">  Business Process Modeling  &#8211; Techniques and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_modeling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Notations</a> </h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As well as talking about the issues and traits portrayed above, which should be followed in the implementation of this discipline, it is imperative also to present the most used techniques in process modeling. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Many techniques have been tested over the years and are sometimes considered a little confusing, due to the many definitions and various ways to reach the proposed end.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is important to know the various techniques available so that the choice fits and adapts the characteristics of the processes to be modeled, facilitating the modeling task and meeting the needs [5], [6], [11], [13]. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> BPMN </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">BPMN&#8217;s intention in business process modeling is very similar to UML&#8217;s for object-oriented design and analysis. This aims to identify best practices from existing approaches and combine them into a new, generally accepted language [5], [6], [10].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Predecessor languages to BPMN included not only graph and Petri-net based languages but also UML and Event-Driven Process Chain (EPC) activity diagrams [8]. While these modeling languages focus on different levels of abstraction, ranging from one business level to a more technical level, BPMN aims to support the full range of abstraction levels, including business levels and software technology levels [8], [27], [15].</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://d2slcw3kip6qmk.cloudfront.net/marketing/pages/chart/seo/bpmn/featured.svg" alt="Diagram" width="350" height="127"/></figure>



<p></p>



<p>This is set out in the standards document, which states: &#8220;BPMN&#8217;s primary goal is to provide a notation that is easily understandable by all business users, from business analysts who create initial process drafts to programmers responsible for implementing technology that will execute these processes and ultimately for business people who will manage and monitor these processes ”[7], [8], [16], [14], [15], [17].</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Colored Petri-nets </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The graphic language provides basic primitives for building models for concurrent systems [18]. It has the characteristic of modeling discrete events as well as communication and synchronization, combining the capabilities of Petri-nets with those of a high-level programming language [5], [6], [14], [19].</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Data flow diagrams (DFD or Yourdon´s technique) </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Developed in the early 1960s by Larry Constantine and Ed Yourdon, DFDs can be seen as methods of organizing data from their raw state [13]. It aims to show how information flows from one place to another, as well as their relationship with users and the outer. They can be used to record process reviews as part of project documentation [20]</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://d2slcw3kip6qmk.cloudfront.net/marketing/pages/chart/seo/data-flow-diagram/discovery/featured.svg" alt="Diagram" width="350" height="200"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong> </strong></p>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Event-Driven Process Chain (EPC)  </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Informal notation for the representation of business processes and concepts to the detriment of the formal aspects of their technical realization [13]. It is part of a holistic modeling approach called the Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) framework [20] developed by August-Wilhelm Scheer [5], [6].</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="407" height="261" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/edpc.png" alt="Business Process Modeling - event driven process chain" class="wp-image-265" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/edpc.png 407w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/edpc-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 407px) 100vw, 407px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> FlowChart  </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Because it is made up of a few symbol patterns, it is easily understood. Also, its simplicity has made it a robust and effective tool, being one of the precursors of many other graphic languages and notations, being used for many years in process modeling. It uses a sequential flow of actions and does not support a division of activities. BPMN notation can be considered as an advanced version of this technique [13].</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://d2slcw3kip6qmk.cloudfront.net/marketing/pages/chart/examples/flowchart-templates/sample-flowchart.svg" alt="sample flowchart" width="720" height="600"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Gantt Chart</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It lists a to-do list with a timescale and can be used for process representation, although its focus is on the ability to monitor the current situation, project schedule, and resource allocation, eventually neglecting the modeling part [20], [13].</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Integrated Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF) </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">They are sets of methods for integrated modeling, directed to the business area and companies. They are used according to different applications, IDEF0, IDEF1, IDEF1X, IDEF2, IDEF3, IDEF4, and IDEF5 the most important parts of this family of methods [10].<br> However, for business process modeling, the most useful versions are IDEF0 and IDEF3 [20], [13].</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1172" height="484" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IDEF_Box_Format.jpg" alt="Business Process Modeling - IDEF" class="wp-image-266" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IDEF_Box_Format.jpg 1172w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IDEF_Box_Format-300x124.jpg 300w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IDEF_Box_Format-768x317.jpg 768w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IDEF_Box_Format-1024x423.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1172px) 100vw, 1172px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Object-Oriented Methods (OO) </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Method for analysis, design, and implementation from the object-oriented technique, there are many different OO-based techniques [21]. UML is considered the default OO modeling language [13]</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Petri Nets</h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Petri nets are one of the best-known techniques for specifying formal and abstract business processes, as such, provide an important basis for process languages. &#8220;Formal&#8221; means that the semantics of the process instances resulting from the models specified in Petri nets are well-defined, unambiguous, and &#8220;abstract&#8221; because they do not take into account the execution environment of a business process so that all aspects beyond functional and process perspectives are not covered [5], [6], [13].</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="355" height="171" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Detailed_petri_net.png" alt="Business Process Modeling - Petri Nets" class="wp-image-267" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Detailed_petri_net.png 355w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Detailed_petri_net-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Role-Activity Diagrams (RAD) </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">An abstract notation to describe desired behavior within an organization. They are often organizational functions and may include software systems, customers, and suppliers [22]. They provide a different perspective on the process and are particularly useful in supporting communication [13].</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Role-Interaction Diagrams (RID) </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Although slightly more complex than a flowchart, RIDs are quite intuitive to understand, and easy to read, but tend to be confusing and difficult to build [13].</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> UML Activity Diagram </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">UML is a modeling language used primarily for software system specification, visualization, development, and documentation [7]. It has also become a powerful business process modeling technique. With 14 different types, it offers a flexible and powerful way to view almost every business process [19], [10].</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1300" height="805" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UML-activity-diagram-examples-transparent.png" alt="Business Process Modeling - UML activiy diagram" class="wp-image-268" srcset="https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UML-activity-diagram-examples-transparent.png 1300w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UML-activity-diagram-examples-transparent-300x186.png 300w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UML-activity-diagram-examples-transparent-768x476.png 768w, https://jailsonevora.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/UML-activity-diagram-examples-transparent-1024x634.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> Workflow Diagram </h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Workflow diagrams are an approach to improving traditional Petri nets with concepts and notations that make it easier to represent business processes by introducing structural constraints that prove useful for business processes [5], [6].</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="262" height="192" src="../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wf.png" alt="Business Process Modeling - Workflow diagram" class="wp-image-269"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is more than a technique for modeling a process. It is a methodology for analyzing and improving a process, including its modeling. It comprises four steps: <strong>information gathering</strong>, <strong>modeling of business processes, workflow modeling and implementation, verification, and enforcement</strong> [13].<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="has-drop-cap has-medium-font-size">Process automation can be approached from different perspectives and may refer to the intention to automate any conceivable part of procedural work within a business process [1]. This ranges from simple operations that are part of a single process activity to coordinating automated whole and complex processes [2].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> This intention to automate any conceivable part of procedural work leads to the Workflow concept. Workflow is understood as a process that is fully or partially automated by software, which transmits information from one participant to another according to the time and logic defined in the underlying process model [2].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> This post addresses key concepts associated with process automation from the definition of a workflow to the presentation of its concepts and characteristics.  </p>



<div style="height:64px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Process Automation &#8211; Historical retrospective</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Before going into detail about the concept, it is important to make a temporal survey to fit the concept with the current reality, as well as understand the origins and emergence of this “new” approach in the world of organizations and IT.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Thus, in the 1990s arose the <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wfmc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Workflow Management Collation</a> (WfMC)</strong>, was founded to set standards related to workflows, it was created by IT and business companies, as well as users and academics. This organization felt the need to define and standardize the term Workflow Management System (WfMS), understanding it as a system that defines, creates, and manages the execution of workflows through the use of software, capable of interpreting the process, interacting with participants as well as when necessary to invoke the use of IT tools and applications [3], [4].</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Looking back, it can be seen that over the years there have been several milestones around the development of information systems. From a historical summary, the following stand out [5]:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><em>1965-1975</em></strong>: <strong>the decomposition of applications</strong>, which comprised applications separated by layers, unlike previous monolithic applications, each with its own databases and definitions;</li>



<li><em><strong>1975-1985</strong></em>: <strong>database management</strong>, removal of data management from the application, increasing by large scale the emergence of DBMS;</li>



<li><strong><em>1985-1995</em></strong>: <strong>user interface</strong>, removal of  interface management from  applications; </li>



<li><strong><em>1995-2005</em></strong>: <strong>workflow</strong>, the removal of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="business processes (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_automation" target="_blank">business processes</a> from applications.</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Given the evolution of information systems in recent decades, especially with the removal of business processes from within applications, [5] W. M. P. Van Der Aalst et al makes an analogy, comparing WfMS to DBMS, in the sense that just as databases are developed and used with the help of DBMS, WfMS can also be used to define and use workflow systems.<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></p>



<div style="height:61px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Process Automation &#8211; Workflow Definition<gwmw style="display:none;"></gwmw></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The term workflow, which is the focus of WfMS, is often placed in the relationship of dependency between process management and analysis, and can also be understood as the way workflows through the process, the activities that are performed on it, the people involved, and the information necessary for their conclusion.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is common to find references to process management as workflow management and information systems that support workflow management as being called WfMS [6]. The term workflow management is often referred to as being the controller of actions taken on documents moving through a business process. Specifically, WfMS is used to determine and control who can access which document, what operations employees can perform on a given document, which sequence of operations are performed [6], and is able to integrate between a set of systems. Similarly, these can also be used to implement business processes in which people are actively involved, thereby improving collaboration between stakeholders [4], [3] and systematization in the sense that all workers can perform a task following the same steps previously modeled.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the face of new needs, this type of system has been and is subject to the constant insertion of new features, making it flexible so that it can cope with the increasing complexity of modern processes. Due to this scope and the expansion of flexibility, it has evolved to incorporate more capabilities and is no longer focused solely on process automation. In the present times, it is common to find references to WfMS as Business Process Management Systems (BPMS). WfMS is understood to be the embryo of BPMS. It is also important to highlight that currently the term WfMS is little used and ends up falling out in favor of BPMS, which is the natural evolution of it.</p>



<div style="height:63px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Process Automation &#8211; Workflow basics</h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> After the definition and historical retrospective, it is already possible to understand a little more about the term workflow and the associated technologies. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is now pertinent to present some key concepts and descriptions, defined by the WfMC [7]: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Activity  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.jeevora.com/2019/08/04/three-functional-areas-of-workflow-systems/" target="_blank">Activity </a></strong>&#8211; Set of events that occur under the responsibility of an actor;</li>



<li><strong>Deadline</strong> &#8211; Based on the wait time each rule in an activity or to-do list needs to complete its goals;</li>



<li><strong>Event </strong>&#8211; Occurrence of a condition causing one or more actions within the system;</li>



<li><strong>Trigger </strong>&#8211; Allows the awakening of activity from an event;</li>



<li><strong>Instance </strong>&#8211; Represents association or addition of data to a particular phase of a process or activity;</li>



<li><strong>Task List </strong>&#8211; Associated to a participant, or group of participants in a workflow, who can share a common list;</li>



<li><strong>Role </strong>&#8211; Actors who have qualifications and rights that enable them to perform an activity;</li>



<li><strong>Participant </strong>&#8211; Resource that performs the work represented by an activity instance, which may be human, equipment, rules, or an organizational unit;</li>



<li><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.jeevora.com/2019/07/30/business-process-modeling/" target="_blank">Process </a></strong>&#8211; A set of procedures or activities related to the goal of achieving a goal within an organizational context;</li>



<li><strong>Timing</strong>&#8211; Formal representation of the interaction of activities, establishing the dependency between them, and specifying which tasks should be performed in parallel, or which may be delayed until another activity is completed;</li>



<li><strong>Task </strong>&#8211; Represents the work done by a participant in a process instance within the context of workflows;</li>



<li><strong>Transition </strong>&#8211;  the process or a period of changing from one state to the other. </li>
</ul>
